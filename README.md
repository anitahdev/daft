# Daft Academy Certificate project

This project was created while I took part in Daft Academy's Frontend 4 Beginners course in May/June 2022. After the course I have recieved a certificate stating of my current skills. The entire Single Page Application was created with create react app, Material UI and Fetch API and written in Typescript.
